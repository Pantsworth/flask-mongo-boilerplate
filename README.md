# flask-mongo-boilerplate

This is a "Hello World"-level boilerplate project that sets up a Flask REST API connected to a MongoDB database. An API enables HTTP connections, along with a frontend for end-user display and interaction.

It's Heroku-friendly. Git-clone it and configure a Heroku application with the free MongoLab attachment.
